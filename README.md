## CleanMeeter

This project is  a digital diary of mine. You can write don all the visits, meetings, events and weddings you took part in.
For a presentation purposes, I created dummy data which will be presented on a video soon.

At the moment, not all features were implemented in the refactorized version. I created some dummy data for the presentation purposes. Here I only show the finnished ones.
